[Rover](https://github.com/spin-the-hexagon/rover) is a next generation Roblox object management framework that makes use of Signals and Code Generation.

## Who is it for

First and foremost, Rover is for us at [Spin The Hexagon](https://github.com/spin-the-hexagon/), for our games.

But if you're not a part of our team, Rover is great for:

* Performance
* Code simplicity
* Control

Rover is bad for:

* People who don't want to learn new things

There really is no large downsides to using Rover, aside from slightly more verbose state management code due to constraints of recursives we dont know how to fix.
